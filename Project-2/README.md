# EE 464 PROJECT#2

## Draft Version

## Isolated Converters & Controller Design

### Deadline: 19/04/2018 23:59

In this project you are going to work with your hardware project partners (2-3 people per team).

Please check [evaluation.md](evaluation.md) for other details and evaluation criteria about the project.

## Q1) Isolated Converter Simulation

In this step, you need to simulate the hardware project you had previously chosen. Input and output voltages and power requirements are same for the hardware requirements.

a) Simulate the converter and show its proper operation

b) Design a transformer (choose material, core, number of turns etc) and estimate its equivalent circuit parameters. You can use application notes, and commercially available cores.  Explain in detail of your design process

c) Simulate the transformer with non-ideal switches to observe the voltage-current oscillations in the swithces. Design any snubbers if required. Again, you may refer to application notes for this purpose.

d)

e) Component Selection: Choose the components that you will use in your hardware project (i.e. switches, diodes, capacitors etc.) and justify your selection by referring to the relevant specs from the components' datasheet.


### Q2) Controller Design

For the specs you have choosen in the hardware project, now design a buck, or boost converter. You can slightly modify your specs if required (for example 230 VAC, can be assumed as 200V dc etc.).

a) For the converter, obtain the controller transfer function, and present the bode-plot analytically.

b) Obtain the same characteristics,using the computer simulation toolbox.

c) Design a Type-II controller

d) Show the performance of the controller by:
