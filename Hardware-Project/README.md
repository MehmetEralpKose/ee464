# EE464 Hardware Project
Specs for the hardware project are listed below. You need to form a group of 2/3 students and reserve the project that you choose. You are not allowed to have a group with any of your group members from the first semester.

Once you determined your group members, please write it up in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KAVsJwLUg4EU7Spf6T_P4cAQa5IwYKrkkvP4pl3IBME/edit?usp=sharing). 
Also put the project number you would like to work on. One group per project is allowed. First come first served.

|Project No|Vin (V) |Vout (V)|Pout (W)|Topology|

|1|48|12|80|Forward|
|2|48|12|80|Flyback|
|3|48|24|100|Forward|
|4|48|24|100|Flyback|
|5|24|12|80|Forward|
|6|24|12|80|Flyback|
|7|12|48|80|Flyback|
|8|230 AC|9|10|Flyback|
|9|230 AC|15|15|Flyback|
|10|48|12|80|Phase-Shifted Full Bridge|
|11|48|24|100|Phase-Shifted Full Bridge|

Here are some important notes:

- Project specs are arranged such that there is not a significant difference regarding the implementation difficulty. Low voltage applications require higher output power where high voltage (line voltage) projects are low power. 

- Project development phase and final results must be open source. You are required to share the knowledge by properly prepared reports. All simulation files, PCB design files, bill of materials, design regarding magnetic elements should be made available as open access.

- After succeeding the voltage level conversion, you will probably want to pursue additional merits for your converter. These may include:

    - Higher efficiency
    - Compact design
    - High power density
    - Multi-output design (especially for project 9)
    - Employing soft switching techniques (especially for project 10-11)
    - Providing more output power than required

- All of the additional converter merits and any other effort that you put outside this project definition will be awarded in grading, accordingly.

- You may also have a power conversion scheme in your mind. (Required for work, summer practice, for your hobby project etc.) You can propose other topologies and specs outside the ones listed above. Make sure the new project you propose involves some kind of magnetic design (because all of the above have).

- Converters on breadboard are okay but we expect you to start early and exhibit your final design on a PCB.

- TI shares a lot of its designs, in detail. Please check: http://www.ti.com/general/docs/refdesignsearchresults.tsp

- You can find converter designs on web and (partly) utilize their solution by properly citing them. Do not try to find an overall design to evade the design effort. We also have a large collection of converter designs published online.

- Most of the power companies (especially TI) send free samples.

- Based on your hardware experience in EE463, you should remember that it is vital to prepare your shopping list early. Contact local and international component dealers as soon as possible.
